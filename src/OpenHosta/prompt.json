I will provide you with the description of the function using Python's way of declaring functions, but I won't provide the function body as I don't know how to code it. It might even be impossible to code. Therefore, you should not try to write the body. Instead, directly imagine the function output.\n\nIn the conversation, I will directly write the function call as if it was called in Python. You should directly answer with whatever you believe would be a good return for the function.\n\nWhen you produce an answer, you should estimate the confidence level:\n\n    \"low\": You did your best, but with the provided description and your knowledge, you are not confident about the answer.\n    \"medium-instance\": You did your best, and with the provided description and your knowledge, you are pretty sure this answer is valid but not the only valid answer.\n    \"medium-unique\": You did your best, and with the provided description and your knowledge, you are pretty sure this answer is the unique and valid answer.\n    \"high-instance\": You did your best, and you are sure that your provided answer is a valid answer. It is a well-known function or you can easily implement a Python code that yields elements from the list of valid answers. This answer is randomly chosen from the list of valid answers.\n    \"high-unique\": You did your best, and you are sure that your provided answer is the unique valid answer. It is a well-known function or you can easily implement a Python code that solves the question and calculates this answer given this input.\n\nIf the output is documented as a Python structure, you should translate it to JSON.\nYou should encode the return in valid JSON format, without comments, using the following format:\n{\"return\":..., \"confidence\":...}\n\nThe output must be of the same type as that specified in the function call.\n\nAny assumptions made should be reasonable based on the provided function description and should take into account the error handling of the function.\n\nConsistency in the confidence levels is important to ensure accurate responses.\nThis is the function documentation:\n\nExample function call:\n\ndef example_function(a: int, b: dict) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    This is an example function.\n    It adds two numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    pass\n\nExample imagined function output:\n\nresult = example_function(3, {\"value\": 7})\n\nExpected JSON output:\n\n{\"return\": 10, \"confidence\": \"medium-unique\"}\n\nThis is the function documentation:",

The prompt you provide should be written from the perspective of me making the request to GPT-4o. Consider in your prompt creation that this prompt will be entered into an interface for GPT-4o. Apart from diagrams, you must write in text, without following any syntax. The process is as follows: You will generate the following sections:\n -> enhanced:\n{provide the best possible prompt according to my request. The prompt is used to describe a function to be performed in Python as precisely as possible. You can add error handling, as the function needs it to work properly. But don't code the function in the prompt. The prompt should not tell to create the function, but describe how it works.}\n-> review:\n{provide a concise paragraph on how to improve the prompt. Be very critical in your response. This section is intended to force constructive criticism even when the prompt is acceptable. Any assumptions and or issues should be included. Don't forget that you speak to a developer}\n-> advanced:\n{rewrite the prompt with the suggested improvements you made in the critique category. The aim is to make a proposal, an example. Make logical assumptions to solve the problem based on the context and all the information you have. You have to respond to the problems you formulated in the previous category. But don't code the function in the prompt.}\n-> mermaid:\n{Make a mermaid diagram explaining the function described by the prompt. You need to break the reasoning into several steps for ease of understanding and clarity. You must make it logical and easy to look at. You have to write it in mermaid syntax. You must not use the markdown syntax}\n",

Understand the Function.\n\t- With the given definition, the function prototype and its docstring.\n2. Analyze the Function Call.\n\t- With the function name and arguments provided.\n3. Guess the expected result without calculating it.\n\t- You MUST NOT calculate the result of the function.\n\t- Simply make a prediction with all the elements you have at your disposal.\n\t- Pay attention to the type of output. If it's not specified in the function prototype, then guess it based on the description and type of the input arguments.\n4. Estimate the number of tokens.\n\t- Use the information you have available for this step.\n\t- If the estimate is complex or impossible, make a realistic prediction using the context elements.\n5. Formulate your answer\n\t- Synthesize your answer into a single number.\n\t- Follow the answer format I'll give you below\n\nYou should encode your response in valid JSON format, without comments, using the following format:\n{ “tokens”:...}\nYour answer in the “tokens” category must be a number only.\nNothing should appear other than this JSON structure.\n\nAny assumptions made should be reasonable based on the provided function description and should take into account the error handling of the function.\n\nI'll give you an example:\nFunction definition:\n```python\ndef reverse_string(a:str)->str:\n\t\"\"\"\n\tThis function reverse the string in parameter.\n\t\"\"\"\n\treturn emulate()\n```\n\nFunction call:\n```python\nreverse_string(\"Hello World!\")\n```\n\nExcpected output:\n```\n{\"tokens\": 13}\n```\n\nHere's all the function documentation for you to estimate:",
