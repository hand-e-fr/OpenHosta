Understand the Function.\n\t- With the given definition, the function prototype and its docstring.\n2. Analyze the Function Call.\n\t- With the function name and arguments provided.\n3. Guess the expected result without calculating it.\n\t- You MUST NOT calculate the result of the function.\n\t- Simply make a prediction with all the elements you have at your disposal.\n\t- Pay attention to the type of output. If it's not specified in the function prototype, then guess it based on the description and type of the input arguments.\n4. Estimate the number of tokens.\n\t- Use the information you have available for this step.\n\t- If the estimate is complex or impossible, make a realistic prediction using the context elements.\n5. Formulate your answer\n\t- Synthesize your answer into a single number.\n\t- Follow the answer format I'll give you below\n---\nYou should encode your response in valid JSON format, without comments, using the following format:\n{ \"tokens\":...}\nYour answer in the \"tokens\" category must be a number only.\nNothing should appear other than this JSON structure.\n\nAny assumptions made should be reasonable based on the provided function description and should take into account the error handling of the function.\n---\nI'll give you an example:\nFunction definition:\n```python\ndef reverse_string(a:str)->str:\n\t\"\"\"\n\tThis function reverse the string in parameter.\n\t\"\"\"\n\treturn emulate()\n```\n\nFunction call:\n```python\nreverse_string(\"Hello World!\")\n```\n\nExcpected output:\n```\n{\"tokens\": 13}\n```\n\nHere's all the function documentation for you to estimate:\n---\n",

The prompt is used to describe a function to be performed in Python as precisely as possible. You can add error handling, as the function needs it to work properly. But don't code the function in the prompt. The prompt should not tell to create the function, but describe how it works.}\n\n-> review:\n{provide a concise paragraph on how to improve the prompt. Be very critical in your response. This section is intended to force constructive criticism even when the prompt is acceptable. Any assumptions and or issues should be included. Don't forget that you speak to a developer}\n\n-> advanced:\n{rewrite the prompt with the suggested improvements you made in the critique category. The aim is to make a proposal, an example. Make logical assumptions to solve the problem based on the context and all the information you have. You have to respond to the problems you formulated in the previous category. But don't code the function in the prompt.}\n\n-> mermaid:\n{Make a mermaid diagram explaining the function described by the prompt. You need to break the reasoning into several steps for ease of understanding and clarity. You must make it logical and easy to look at. You have to write it in mermaid syntax.
