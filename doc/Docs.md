Documentation for version: **1.0**

Welcome to **OpenHosta** documentation :). Here you'll find all the **explanations** you need to understand the library, as well as** usage examples** and advanced **configuration** methods for the most complex tasks. You'll also find explanations of the source code for those interested in **contributing** to this project. Check the Jupyter Notebook **test files** to help you take your first steps in discovering OpenHosta.

For this project, we have adopted a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure a respectful and inclusive environment for all contributors. Please take a moment to read it.

### Introduction

#### First Step

OpenHosta is a **Python library** designed to facilitate the integration of **LLMs** into the developer's environment, by adding a layer to the Python programming language without distorting it. It is based on the **PMAC** concept, reimagining the **compilation** process in “Just-In-Time” languages. All our functionalities respect the **syntax and paradigm** of this language. 

The choice of LLM is mostly up to you, depending on your configuration level, but the vast majority are compatible. By default, OpenAI's **GPT-4o** is chosen. This has been tested by our team during development and **guarantees** a sufficient level of functionality. 

Whatever your configuration, make sure you're provided with a **working API key** before proceeding. Keep in mind that each request will incur **costs** which are different depending on the model. You can find prices on distributor websites. Here are the prices for the OpenAI API: https://openai.com/api/pricing/

We've already mentioned a few concepts about **AI** or **computer science**. If some of them may be **unclea**r to you, please have a look at the *“references”* section, where a series of explanatory links or definitions will be listed to **help** you understand.

Finally, if you like the project and are thinking of contributing, please refer to our [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)

#### Why use OpenHosta?

- **Beyond programming**

OpenHosta allows you to code functions that are complex or even impossible **before**, by adding the ambiguity of **human language**, or the processing of language relating to social codes or other parameters that are **difficult** to implement in Python for example. It **simplifies** tasks that would otherwise require significant time and expertise, thus expanding **possibilities** in Python programming.

- **Open-Source**
- **AI-based**
