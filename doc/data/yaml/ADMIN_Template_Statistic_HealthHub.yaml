  description: The 'Stats_Evt_OpDat' dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of
    operational data and event statistics, allowing users to filter data based on
    various time scales and explore detailed visualizations through interactive area
    and bar charts. It facilitates in-depth analysis of data trends and event occurrences
    over time.

    question: What are the statistics and ratios related to the operational data and
      events in the system?
    title: Last Stats
    type: vertical bar
  - description: This area chart visualizes the 'opDatTotal' over different time scales,
      filtered based on user-selected parameters. The x-axis represents the time scale,
      which can be displayed as a string, day, week, month, quarter, or year depending
      on the parameter settings. The y-axis shows the 'opDatTotal' as an integer value.
    position: top
    question: What is the total number of operational data entries over different
      time scales?
    title: Operational Data Visualization
    type: area
  - description: This area plot visualizes the 'evtInserted' values over different
      time scales filtered based on the parameter settings. The x-axis represents
      the 'TimeScale Filt' which can vary from timestamp to year depending on the
      parameter values.
    position: bottom
    question: How does the number of events vary over different time scales?
    title: Event Plot
    type: area
  - description: This area chart visualizes the discarded past operational data over
      a time scale. The x-axis represents the time scale filtered by the selected
      parameter, while the y-axis shows the count of discarded past operational data.
    position: bottom left
    question: What is the number of OpDatas discarded over different time scales?
    title: Operational Data Discarded Past
    type: area
  - description: This area chart visualizes the discarded events over different time
      scales. The x-axis represents the time scale filtered by the parameter, and
      the y-axis shows the count of discarded events.
    position: bottom right

  name: Any project
variables:
- description: This variable tracks the number of past events that were discarded.
    It is used to calculate the ratio of discarded events to total events.
  generic_name: evtDiscardedPast
- description: This variable tracks the number of events inserted. It is recorded
    as context data for events.
  generic_name: evtInserted
- description: The total number of events recorded in the system. It includes all
    events regardless of their status.
  generic_name: evtTotal
- description: This variable represents the count of operational data points that
    were discarded due to being past or repeated. It helps in analyzing data quality
    and operational efficiency.
  generic_name: opDatDiscardedPastOrRepeat
- description: This variable tracks the number of operational data entries inserted.
    It is recorded continuously as operational data.
  generic_name: opDatInserted
- description: This variable represents the total operational data recorded continuously
    for a train unit. It is used in multiple dashboards to monitor and analyze train
    performance.
  generic_name: opDatTotal
- description: This variable represents the project identifier used in various dashboards.
    It is recorded as context data for events and operational data.
  generic_name: prj
- description: The timestamp variable records the date and time of events. It is used
    to filter and plot data across various dashboards.
  generic_name: timestamp
- description: The upTime variable represents the total operational time of the train
    engine. It is recorded continuously as operational data.
