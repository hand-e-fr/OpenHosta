    question: What are the occurrences and values of the Unit over time?
    title: Coupling-Unit C1
    type: table
  - description: The plot visualizes the relationship between value and Unit. The
      x-axis represents 'value' which is a real number, and the y-axis represents
      'Unit' which is a string. Since the y-axis is categorical, the plot is displayed
      as a table where each cell is colored based on the 'Unit' variable.

      and variables?
    title: Coupling-Trend C1
    type: vertical bar
  - description: This visualization displays the trend of values over time, with dates
      on the x-axis and calculated values on the y-axis. Each bar represents a specific
      date and its corresponding value.

  description: The 'Ratio' dashboard provides insights into the ratio of Time Coupling
    (TC) and Occurrence Coupling (OC) across different units. It includes interactive
    tables that allow users to explore detailed data and understand the distribution
    of these ratios, with color-coded cells for easy comparison.

      C1 and C2?
    title: Ratio TC by Unit
    type: table
  - description: This plot visualizes the Ratio C against the Unit. The Ratio C is
      calculated as the sum of TC1 divided by the sum of TC1 and C1. Since the y-axis
      is categorical, the plot is displayed as a table where each cell's color and
      value are determined by the Unit.
