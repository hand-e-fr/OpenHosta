dashboards:
- count: 1
  description: The 'Main' dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of ratios related
    to mileage and unit counts. It allows for detailed exploration of data where mileage
    exceeds 50, featuring interactive tables that visualize these ratios and facilitate
    in-depth analysis.
  filters:
  - description: Filtering by datetime, specifically for the 'Last' caption.

    question: What is the ratio of SUM(IOS) to Mileage per kilometer, considering
      only cases where Mileage exceeds 50?
    title: Main-ratio Visualization
    type: table
  - description: 'This visualization represents the ratio of units, calculated using
      the formula: ''IF MAX([Mileage]) > 50 THEN SUM([N])*100/MAX([Mileage]) ELSE
      0 END''. The x-axis shows the ratio, and the y-axis categorizes the data by
      Unit.'

    question: What is the ratio of SUM(IOS) * 100 per km based on the provided variables
      and context?
