dashboards:
- count: 1
  description: The 'Dash' dashboard provides comprehensive visualizations to analyze
    the distribution of values and color levels over time across different parameters.
    It allows detailed data exploration through interactive tables, line charts, and
    vertical bar charts, enabling users to understand the relationships between various
    variables and their impact on the fleet's performance.
  filters:
  - description: Filtering applicable to workbooks. This filter is based on the real
      datatype and uses a Tableau formula to determine if the variable equals Parameter
      2, then returns the value. It is used for filtering within a specified value
      range.

  worksheets:
  - description: This visualization represents the 'Value' on the x-axis and 'evt_gts'
      on the y-axis. The color and value of each cell are determined by 'Colouring
      all'.

    question: What is the distribution of values for different color levels over time
      in the fleet?
    title: A-Fleet Visualization
    type: table
  - description: This visualization shows the 'Value' on the x-axis and 'evt_gts'
      on the y-axis. The 'Colouring' axis is used to fill each cell with a color based
      on the provided conditions.
    position: bottom right
    question: What is the distribution of values over time for the given parameters?
    title: A-Train Visualization
    type: table
  - description: This visualization shows the 'evt_gts' on the x-axis as datetime
      values and 'Value' on the y-axis, categorized by '_Location_string'.
    position: center
    question: How does the color type and levels affect the timeline of events?
    title: A-Timeline
    type: line
  - description: This visualization presents the data for GreeAbove. The chart type
      is automatically selected based on the data characteristics.
    position: top left
    question: How do different parameters influence the color levels and values over
      time?
    title: GreeAbove Analysis
    type: vertical bar
  - description: The plot visualizes the variable 'RedBelow' with automatic chart
      type selection. Since 'RedBelow' is not used and its datatype is real, it is
      displayed in a suitable format.
    position: top right
    question: What is the relationship between the different color levels and the
      variables such as diameter and time since last event?
