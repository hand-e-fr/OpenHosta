  - description: This visualization displays the energy consumption (PCE Energy) with
      units categorized. The Snow Brake Activated status is used to fill the color
      and value of each cell.
    position: bottom left
    question: What is the PCE consumption of Snow Brake per Unit?
    title: Energy Consumption Analysis
    type: table
  - description: This visualization displays the PCE Energy consumption calculated
      from PCE1 and PCE2. The fill color represents the Snow Brake Activation status.
    position: top left
    question: What is the energy consumption of the Snow Brake in kWh?
    title: Energy Fleet Analysis
    type: table
  - description: This plot shows the duration of various units. The x-axis represents
      the duration in hours, calculated as [Time]/3600, while the y-axis categorizes
      the units. The color fill represents the 'Snow Brake Activated' status, using
      the formula IFNULL([SnowBrakeActivated],0).
    position: bottom right
    question: What is the duration of snow brake activation per unit?
    title: A-Time Visualization
    type: table
  - description: This visualization displays the duration of fleet time in hours,
      with the Snow Brake Activated status used to fill each cell. The x-axis represents
      the duration, and the fill axis shows the Snow Brake Activated status.
    position: top right
    question: How long does the snow brake activation last in hours?
    title: Fleet Time Analysis
    type: table
  - description: This plot displays the trend of 'Cost Energy Snow Brake' over time,
      using 'LocalDate' as the x-axis. The values are calculated based on the formula
      '[Parameters].[Parameter 1]*[Calculation_127508213647876097]'.
