  description: The 'Alert Infra Train' dashboard provides a comprehensive overview
    of train alert conditions by visualizing their geographical distribution and detailed
    alert counts. Users can filter data based on latitude and longitude, explore detailed
    alert conditions, and interact with graphs to identify top assets with alerts
    over the past 60 days.

  - description: This plot visualizes the relationship between Longitude and Latitude,
      with color indicating different alert conditions. The size of the markers represents
      the number of trains.

    question: What are the latitude and longitude values based on the given conditions?
    title: Longitude vs Latitude with Alert Conditions
    type: gps map with circles
  - description: This visualization displays the number of trains (nb_train) with
      conditions (ALERT_CONDITION) based on the specified calculation for the x-axis
      variable. The x-axis variable is determined by a formula that checks the 'latitude'
      parameter.

  description: The 'Alert Intra Event' dashboard provides a comprehensive overview
    of geographical locations and the number of events under alert conditions, enabling
    detailed exploration and categorization of events based on latitude or longitude
    over the past 60 days.

  general_description: The 'Daily_Alert_Condition_Infra' report provides a comprehensive
    overview of train alert conditions by visualizing their geographical distribution
    and detailed alert counts. Users can filter data based on latitude and longitude,
    explore detailed alert conditions, and interact with graphs to identify top assets
    with alerts over the past 60 days.
  goals:
  - Provide a comprehensive overview of train alert conditions.
  - Visualize geographical distribution and detailed alert counts.
  - Enable users to filter data based on latitude and longitude.
  - Allow exploration of detailed alert conditions.
  - Identify top assets with alerts over the past 60 days.
