variables:
- description: This variable represents an identifier for a part of a train. It is
    used extensively in both context data for events and operational data.
  generic_name: Unit
- description: The variable indicates the last recorded value for a specific train
    component. It is used to determine the most recent operational status.
  generic_name: last
- description: This variable identifies different versions of software or hardware
    used in the trains. It is used in various dashboards to distinguish between software
    and hardware versions.
  generic_name: version_id
- description: This variable represents the location version of a train component.
    It is used in both software and hardware version reports.
  generic_name: version_loc
- description: This variable indicates the sub-location version of a train unit. It
    is used in various operational dashboards to distinguish between different hardware
    and software versions.
