  description: The 'Main' dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of time-related
    trends and distributions across various units and missions. It enables users to
    explore detailed time differences, mission durations, and unit distributions through
    interactive tables and line plots.

  - description: This line plot visualizes the 'Time' values over 'date'. The x-axis
      represents dates, and the y-axis shows the time differences.
    position: bottom right
    question: What is the trend of the variable 'Diff' over time?
    title: Main-Trend
    type: line
  - description: This plot visualizes the Time on the x-axis and Unit on the y-axis.
      Since the y-axis is categorical, the plot is represented as a table with cells
      colored based on the Unit.
    position: top left
    question: What is the distribution of units over time?
    title: Main-Unit Visualization
    type: table
  - description: This visualization displays the relationship between Time and Mission.
      Since the y-axis variable is categorical, the resulting plot is presented as
      a table. Each cell is colored and valued based on the fill variable.

    question: What is the time taken for each mission?
    title: Main-Mission Plot
    type: table
  - description: This visualization shows the distribution of missions over time,
      using the 'Mission' variable for the y-axis and 'Time' for the text axis. Since
      'Mission' is a string, the plot is represented as a table where each cell's
      color and value are determined by the 'fill' variable.

  general_description: The 'Main' dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of time-related
    trends and distributions across various units and missions. It enables users to
    explore detailed time differences, mission durations, and unit distributions through
    interactive tables and line plots.
  goals:
  - Provide an in-depth analysis of time-related trends and distributions across various
    units and missions.
  - Enable users to explore detailed time differences, mission durations, and unit
    distributions through interactive tables and line plots.
  - Visualize the 'Time' values over 'date' to understand the trend of the variable
    'Diff' over time.
  - Show the distribution of units over time.
  - Display the relationship between Time and Mission.
  - Analyze the time difference in the mission data based on the given variables.
