- count: 1
  description: The 'Dash' dashboard provides a comprehensive view of data distributions
    and color classifications over time. It allows for detailed data exploration through
    various visualizations, including tables, line plots, and vertical bar charts,
    facilitating the understanding of relationships and conditions among different
    parameters.
  filters:
  - description: Filtering applicable to workbooks based on the real datatype and
      a specific formula that checks if a variable matches a parameter, then returns
      a value.

variables:
- description: This variable indicates the type of color control used in the train's
    operational data. It is used in various dashboards for visualizing train performance
    metrics.
  generic_name: ColorTypeCtrl
- description: This variable represents the operational data for a specific part of
    the train. It is used to monitor the condition above a certain threshold.
  generic_name: GreeAbove
- description: Image data is used in the dashboards to visualize operational conditions
    of train components. It is recorded as context data for specific events.
  generic_name: Image
- description: Level 0 represents the initial level of the train's hierarchy. It is
    used across various dashboards for operational data analysis.
  generic_name: Level_0
- description: This variable represents the first level of some hierarchical structure
    within the train's operational data. It is used extensively across multiple dashboards
    to filter and plot data.
  generic_name: Level_1
- description: Level 2 indicates the hierarchical position within the train's operational
    data. It is used for filtering and plotting various dashboard metrics.
  generic_name: Level_2
- description: This variable is used to classify the train levels. It is recorded
    as operational data.
  generic_name: Level_3
- description: This variable is recorded continuously as operational data. It is used
    to monitor train operations across multiple dashboards.
  generic_name: Level_4
- description: This variable is recorded continuously as operational data. It is used
    in various dashboards to monitor train performance.
