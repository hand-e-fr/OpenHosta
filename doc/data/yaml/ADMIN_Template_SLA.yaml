  description: The 'SLA' dashboard provides an overview of Service-Level Agreement
    (SLA) performance, categorizing data by date and project. It includes various
    visualizations like tables and bar charts that allow for detailed exploration
    of key performance indicators and SLA metrics, with interactive elements to compare
    different SLA percentages and performance thresholds.

    question: What are the key performance indicators and their values for the given
      time period in the report?
    title: SLA - 1
    type: table
  - description: This bar chart displays the 'Date' on the x-axis and 'Existing' values
      on the y-axis. The size of each bar is represented by 'One'.

    question: What is the service level agreement (SLA) performance based on the provided
      data?
    title: SLA-2 Visualization
    type: vertical bar
  - description: This plot displays the data with 'Date' on the x-axis and 'Report
      Name' on the y-axis. Since 'Report Name' is a string, the plot is represented
      as a table where each cell is colored based on the 'fill' variable.

    question: What is the Service-Level Agreement (SLA) performance based on the provided
      variables and calculations?
    title: SLA-3 Visualization
    type: table
  - description: This table visualizes the project data categorized by date. Each
      cell is color-coded based on the SLA percentage ranges.

variables:
- description: This variable measures existing operational data of train units. It
    is used to calculate SLA performance.
  generic_name: Existing
- description: This variable indicates the freshness of the data. It is used to ensure
    that the data is up-to-date and reliable.
  generic_name: Freshness
- description: The variable represents missing data points in the train's operational
    records. It is used to calculate the Service-Level Agreement (SLA).
  generic_name: Missing
- description: This variable is used for identifying events and operational data in
    train dashboards. It helps in tracking and correlating various metrics for maintenance
    and service-level agreements.
