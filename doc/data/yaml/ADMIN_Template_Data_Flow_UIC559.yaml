  worksheets:
  - description: This visualization displays a table where each cell's color represents
      the result of the formula 'IF SUM(error) > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END'. The 'file'
      variable is displayed on the y-axis.
    position: bottom right
    question: What is the error rate based on file data and other variables?
    title: A-1
    type: table
  - description: This visualization shows the distribution of 'file' values over time.
      Each circle represents a different 'flow_type' for the given 'file' at a specific
      'timestamp'.
    position: bottom
    question: What is the relationship between file, timestamp, and flow_type in the
      given data?
    title: Circle Plot of File vs Timestamp
    type: circle
  - description: This table displays the relationship between error and Unit, where
      each cell is colored and valued based on the fill variable.
    position: top right
    question: What are the units and errors associated with the given data over time?
    title: Error vs Unit
