  worksheets:
  - description: This visualization displays the gap analysis using the 'Gap' variable
      on the x-axis and 'Unit' variable on the y-axis. The size of the points is also
      determined by the 'Gap' variable.
    position: bottom left
    question: What is the gap from the median for units in motion?
    title: FleetView Gap Analysis
    type: vertical bar
  - description: This line plot visualizes the timestamp against the value. The x-axis
      represents the timestamp, and the y-axis represents the value. The data is filled
      with the Variable.
    position: top right
    question: What is the relationship between timestamp and value in the Time View
      plot?
    title: TimeView Plot
    type: line
  - description: This area plot visualizes the relationship between Delta (x-axis)
      and Delta (y-axis). The fill axis represents Variable, which categorizes the
      data points.
    position: bottom right
    question: What is the behavior of the Delta variable in the dataset?
    title: Delta vs Delta Area Plot
    type: area
  - description: This visualization represents the Speed over time. The x-axis displays
      the timestamp, while the y-axis shows the Speed in real values.
    position: top
    question: What is the average speed (km/h) of the object in motion over time?
    title: Filter Plot
    type: line
  - description: This plot visualizes the 'Name' variable from the data source '[data]'.
    position: top left
    question: What is the relationship between Name and the conditions defined by
      the variables, particularly the 'In Motion' condition based on Speed?
