  - description: This visualization displays the Gap (calculated using [Ecart]) on
      the x-axis and Units on the y-axis. The size of the elements is determined by
      the Gap value. Given that the y-axis variable is categorical, this plot is most
      likely a table with color and value for each cell.
    position: bottom left
    question: What is the gap from the median in the context of vehicle motion and
      speed?
    title: FleetView Plot
    type: table
  - description: This line plot visualizes the 'value' over time using the 'timestamp'
      as the x-axis. The 'Variable' is used for color coding each data point.
    position: top right
    question: What is the relationship between timestamp and value in the context
      of speed and motion?
    title: TimeView Line Plot
    type: line
  - description: This area plot visualizes the relationship between Delta (x-axis)
      and Delta (y-axis) with Variable used for color coding.
    position: bottom right
    question: What is the distribution of Delta values and how do they vary with different
      Variables?
    title: Area Plot of Delta vs Delta
    type: area
  - description: This line chart displays the speed measured over time. The x-axis
      represents the timestamp, while the y-axis represents the speed in real numbers.
    position: top
    question: What is the average speed in km/h when the speed is greater than 5?
    title: Speed Over Time
    type: line
  - description: This plot visualizes the data using the variable 'Name' from the
      dataset. The variable 'Name' is a string, and it is used as the text axis in
      the visualization.
    position: top left
    question: What is the relationship between Name and other variables in the dataset?
    title: Name
    type: table
- count: 2
  description: The 'Heatmap' dashboard is designed to analyze and visualize 'Unit'
    values over time. It includes a table to sum 'Over hysteresis' values and a heatmap
    to explore relationships between calculated values and units, facilitating detailed
    data exploration and interaction between visualizations.

      with cells colored based on the 'Over hysteresis' calculation.
    position: top
    question: What is the sum of 'Over hysteresis' values based on the 'Unit' and
      'timestamp'?
    title: Unit over Time
    type: table
  - description: This heatmap visualizes the data where the y-axis represents the
      Calculation_589127144345911297 and the text axis shows unit. The color and value
      of each cell correspond to the data calculations.
