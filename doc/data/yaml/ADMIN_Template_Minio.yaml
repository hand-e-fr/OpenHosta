    question: What is the size distribution per bucket in the dataset?
    title: Minio Size-Bucket 2
    type: table
  - description: This visualization displays the size of various buckets categorized
      by project. The x-axis represents the size, while the y-axis categorizes the
      buckets into 'backup/', 'datawarehouse/', 'upload/', 'download/', 'production/',
      and 'other'. The fill axis uses the 'project' variable to color and value each
      cell.
