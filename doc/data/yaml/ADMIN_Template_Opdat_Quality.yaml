    question: What is the daily list of the Opdat Calendar?
    title: Opdat Calendar - Day List
    type: other
  - description: This plot visualizes the timestamp against the Unit, with Delta Time
      To Next Filter used for cell color and value. The data is presented in a tabular
      format due to the categorical nature of the y-axis variable.

  description: The 'Opdat Frequency' dashboard provides a detailed analysis of operation
    frequencies over time, allowing users to explore median periods, delta times,
    and frequency ranges through interactive tables with color-coded cells based on
    calculated values and unit differentiation.
  filters:
  - description: Filtering applicable to workbooks. Filtering events by location on
      the GPS map, Filtering all or part of the Trains by identifier, Filtering by
      speed, Duration (hour/day/week), Filtering the duration of the train service,
      Time window size for event counting, Filtering all or part of the project's
      'AOI' (Area Of Interest), Filtering maintenance-related depot areas, Filtering
      by operational mode of the Train, Event reference, Filtering by event description,
      Filtering event edges, Filtering by equipment that generated the event report,
      Filtering the severity of events
    name: Unit
  - description: Filtering applicable to workbooks. This filter is used to determine
      the delta time to the next filter. It uses a formula to check if the absolute
      value of delT_opdat is greater than 24*3600*3, in which case it returns NULL,
      otherwise it returns delT_opdat.

  worksheets:
  - description: This visualization represents the frequency of operations over time.
      The y-axis shows the timestamp, and the fill axis uses color conditioning based
      on calculated values to highlight different frequency ranges.

    question: What is the median period per day and how does it relate to the upper
      and lower limits for frequency?
    title: Opdat Frequency - List
    type: table
  - description: This visualization shows the frequency of operations over time with
      delT_opdat values represented. Each cell is colored based on the Unit.

  description: The 'Opdat vs Event' dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of
    the relationship between operational data and events over time. It allows for
    detailed data exploration through interactive visualizations, such as circle and
    polygon charts, enabling users to understand patterns and correlations effectively.

variables:
- description: This variable identifies different parts of a train. It is used in
    both event context data and operational data.
  generic_name: Unit
- description: This variable represents the delta time recorded as operational data.
    It is used to measure time intervals between events in train operations.
