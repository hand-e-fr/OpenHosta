dashboards:
- count: 1
  description: The 'DashBoard' dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of vehicle
    performance and trends over time. It includes tables and plots that allow for
    detailed data exploration and interaction between graphs to identify gaps, trends,
    and distributions in the data.
  filters:

  worksheets:
  - description: This plot displays the gap ('Gap') on the x-axis and the unit ('Unit')
      on the y-axis. Since 'Unit' is a string, this plot is most likely a table. Each
      cell's color and value are determined by the 'Gap' variable.
    position: bottom right
    question: What is the gap from the median speed for vehicles in motion?
    title: FleetView Plot
    type: table
  - description: This line plot displays the relationship between timestamp and value.
      The fill axis variable temp is used for additional context.
    position: top
    question: What trends or patterns can be observed over time using the variables
      such as timestamp, value, and temperature in a line chart?
    title: TimeView Plot
    type: line
  - description: This area plot visualizes the relationship between Delta and Delta,
      with the fill variable 'temp' used to color the values of each cell.
    position: bottom
    question: "What is the distribution of the median temperature per car (\xB0C)\
      \ visualized using a centered histogram?"
    title: Delta vs Delta Area Plot
    type: area
  - description: This line chart displays the speed over time, where the x-axis represents
      timestamps and the y-axis represents speed values.
    position: top left
    question: What is the average speed (km/h) over time based on the given data?

variables:
- description: Delta represents the difference from the median temperature per car.
    It is used in various dashboards to track temperature variations.
  generic_name: Delta
- description: This variable represents the deviation from the median value. It is
    used in several dashboards to analyze train performance.
  generic_name: Ecart
- description: Speed is the rate at which a train travels. It is continuously recorded
    as operational data.
  generic_name: Speed
- description: This variable indicates if the train's speed is above zero. It is used
    in various dashboards to filter and plot data related to train movement.
  generic_name: SpeedAbove0
- description: The median value is used to calculate gaps and monitor temperature.
    It is recorded as operational data.
  generic_name: median_value
- description: Temperature data is used to monitor HVAC performance. It is recorded
    continuously in various dashboards.
  generic_name: temp
- description: This variable represents the time at which data is recorded. It is
    used extensively across various dashboards to track events and operational data.
  generic_name: timestamp
- description: This variable is recorded continuously as operational data. It represents
    a real-time measurement relevant to train operations.
  generic_name: value
- description: This variable represents the vehicle identifier. It is used across
    various dashboards to track train performance.
