  worksheets:
  - description: This table visualizes the distribution of evt_id across different
      Units. Each cell is color-coded based on the evt_id value, providing a clear
      and readable representation of the data.
    position: top left
    question: What are the event details, including unit, event ID, and description,
      represented in a bar chart?
    title: Bursts-fleet Analysis
    type: table
  - description: This plot shows the Date on the x-axis and evt_id on the y-axis.
      Each cell is colored and valued based on evt_id.
    position: top
    question: What is the trend of bursts over time?
    title: Burst-trend-time Visualization
    type: table
  - description: This visualization shows the distribution of data over different
      hours of the day, using 'Date' on the x-axis and 'Hour' on the y-axis. The 'Cnt'
      variable is used to display the count in each cell.
    position: center
    question: What is the trend of bursts over time?
    title: Date vs Hour Analysis
    type: table
  - description: This line chart displays the 'Value' over time, with 'evt_gts' on
      the x-axis and 'Value' on the y-axis. The 'variable' is used for color coding
      each data point.
    position: bottom left
    question: What is the context of bursts over time?
    title: Bursts-context Visualization
    type: line
  - description: This visualization displays the distribution of 'evt_id' across different
      'aoi'. Since 'evt_id' is a string, the resulting plot is presented as a table
      where 'evt_id' values fill each cell.
    position: bottom
    question: What is the trend of bursts in the area of interest?
    title: Burst-trend-aoi Visualization
    type: table
  - description: This table visualization represents the event IDs (evt_id) categorized
      by their respective values. Each cell is filled with the evt_id value, providing
      a clear overview of the distribution.
    position: top right
    question: What are the characteristics and occurrences of events based on their
      IDs and associated data?
    title: Bursts-evt_id Analysis
    type: table
  - description: This plot visualizes data using a polygon chart. It is suitable for
      displaying data points that form a closed shape.
    position: bottom right
    question: What is the definition of bursts in the context of polygons using variables
      such as Date, NbEvt, Time, Unit, and evt_gts?
