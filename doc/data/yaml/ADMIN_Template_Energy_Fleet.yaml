dashboards:
- count: 1
  description: The 'Overview' dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of mileage,
    value, and balance trends over time using various visualizations such as tables,
    area plots, and pie charts. It allows for detailed data exploration through level-based
    color coding and timestamp-based filtering, enabling users to interact with and
    understand the distribution and balance of values across different categories.

    question: What is the balance trend shown in the bar chart, considering the variables
      Level 0, Level 2, Mileage, and timestamp?
    title: A-Trend Analysis
    type: table
  - description: This area plot visualizes the Value over time, where the x-axis represents
      the timestamp and the y-axis represents the calculated Value. The fill axis
      variable is Level 0, which is used to color the areas based on different levels.
    position: bottom left
    question: What are the details of the day based on various levels and values?
    title: Area Plot of Value over Time
    type: area
  - description: This visualization represents the 'Value' across different 'Level
      2' categories. Each cell is colored based on 'Level 0' values.
