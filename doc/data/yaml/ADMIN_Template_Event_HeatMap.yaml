  description: The 'Location' dashboard provides a comprehensive visualization of
    the area of interest (aoi) and its relationship with various environmental factors
    over time. It allows for detailed data exploration through interactive tables,
    heatmaps, and line plots, enabling users to understand trends, distributions,
    and correlations within the dataset.

  - description: This plot visualizes the 'aoi' data categorized by 'idx'. The color
      and value of each cell are determined by the 'aoi' variable.
    position: top left
    question: What is the impact of different environments on the area of interest
      (aoi) over time?
    title: Location-aoi Visualization
    type: table
  - description: This plot displays the Unit distribution across different idx values.
      The x-axis represents the idx, while the y-axis shows the Unit. Since the y-axis
      is categorical, the plot is represented as a table with color-coded cells based
      on the fill variable.
    position: bottom left
    question: What is the relationship between the Unit and the idx in the given dataset?
    title: Location-Unit Plot
    type: table
  - description: This heatmap visualizes the geographical distribution of events using
      longitude (evt_gps_lon) and latitude (evt_gps_lat) coordinates. The intensity
      of the heatmap indicates the concentration of events in different locations.
    position: top right
    question: How does the geographical distribution of events look on the map?
    title: Location-map Heatmap
    type: heatmap
  - description: This visualization displays the relationship between value and value.
      Both axes represent real number data, providing insights into their correlation.
    position: bottom right
    question: What are the environmental data values over time?
    title: Location-Agent ID Plot
    type: histogram
  - description: This plot shows the trend of events over time (evt_gts) with an index
      value (idx). The area of interest (aoi) is used for color coding.
    position: bottom
    question: What are the trends observed in the specified area of interest (aoi)
      over time based on the provided environmental data?
