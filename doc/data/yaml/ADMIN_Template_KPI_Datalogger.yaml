- count: 1
  description: The KPI dashboard provides an interactive exploration of file types
    based on their timestamps and content, using various visualizations like tables
    and circle plots to analyze the relationship between file names and their types
    (500ms or 100ms). It allows for detailed data filtering and interaction between
    graphs for comprehensive data analysis.

    question: What is the type of the file based on its content?
    title: File vs Type
    type: table
  - description: This plot visualizes the 'File' data over time, using circles to
      represent different 'Type' values based on the content of 'File'.

    question: What is the relationship between File timestamps and their types (500ms
      or 100ms) in the Circle chart?
    title: Circle Plot of File by Timestamp
    type: circle
  - description: This plot visualizes the 'Type' of files based on the 'File' variable.
      The data is categorized and displayed as a table where each cell's color and
      value are determined by the 'Type' formula.
