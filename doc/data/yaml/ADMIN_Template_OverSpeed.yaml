  worksheets:
  - description: This plot visualizes the 'aoi' variable categorized by 'idx'. The
      'aoi' variable is displayed using colors in each cell.
    position: top left
    question: What is the distribution of the area of interest (aoi) over the given
      indices?
    title: Location-aoi
    type: table
  - description: This plot displays the 'Unit' values categorized by 'idx'. Since
      'Unit' is a string, the resulting plot is represented as a table. Each cell
      is colored and valued based on the 'Unit' variable.
    position: bottom left
    question: What is the relationship between the Unit and the index (idx) in the
      given dataset?
    title: Location-Unit Plot
    type: table
  - description: This heatmap visualizes the distribution of events based on their
      GPS coordinates. The x-axis represents the longitude (evt_gps_lon) and the y-axis
      represents the latitude (evt_gps_lat).
    position: top right
    question: What is the geographical distribution of the event data based on GPS
      coordinates?
    title: Heatmap of GPS Coordinates
    type: heatmap
  - description: This plot visualizes the relationship between 'value' and 'value'
      using real number data types. The x-axis represents 'value' and the y-axis represents
      'value'.
    position: bottom right
    question: What is the relationship between the environment data values?
    title: Location-Agent ID Plot
    type: vertical bar
  - description: This visualization shows the trend of events (evt_gts) over time,
      categorized by index (idx) and colored by area of interest (aoi).
    position: bottom
    question: What are the trends and patterns observed in the environment data over
      time, specifically focusing on the area of interest (aoi)?
